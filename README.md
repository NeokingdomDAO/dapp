Note: if you want to change from i.e. teledisko to neokingdom, just re-run `vercel link` and choose `dapp-neokingdom` as project name.

## How to add a Subgraph query

- Create a new file inside the `./lib/graphql/queries/subgraph/` folder
- Copy the way other queries are structured to be able to generate TS types
- When the query is ready or after each update remember to run `pnpm codegen:subgraph`
